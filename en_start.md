_The name of this course has changed in 2023. Before this, the course was called Ohjelmistotekniikka._

During this course, you will get to familiarise yourself with the principles behind software development, and apply them to implement a practical project in Python.

During the first three weeks, there will be a few tasks to do either by yourself or in the exercise sessions.
In week 2, you will start working on the main bulk of the course, which is the practical work.
You will advance the project week-by-week, following the [schedule](#schedule) for the course.

The course will be graded primarily through the points you get from the practical work.
Part of the points will be accumulated every week following the goals in the [schedule](#schedule), while the rest will be given for the final submission.
If you have previously implemented relatively large software projects, it may be possible to [perform a credit transfer](#credit-transfer) and complete the course that way.

There is no exam for this course.
You must do the practical work within the timeframe of this course.
You will not be able to continue working on your project during the next course ({{ site.next_course }}), so remember to **reserve enough time each week (10-15h per week) for the whole period!**

You can find more detailed instructions for the practical work [here](/en/tasks).
