**⚠️ The final submission deadline is {{site.en_finaldl}}. Don't be late, this is a hard deadline!**
If you have a *very good reason* for submitting late, contact the professor latest by Tuesday and you can get extra time.

In addition to the working project, tests, and configurations, the final submission should also contain the documentation; i.e.:

- Usage instructions
- Specification document
- Architecture description
- Test document

**Update the specification document that you made in week 2 to reflect the final state of your project.**

**In addition, update the name of your project in LabTool to match your project topic.**

Read the [assessment criteria](/en/tasks/criteria) carefully, to see what is expected of you in terms of code and documentation!

For the documentation, you may use the [reference project]({{site.python_reference_app_url}}) as a good example.

### Explanation of AI usage and feedback

After you are done, answer the questionnaire about ChatGPT (and other AI model) usage, as well as submitting course feedback.
Both of these are worth one point, and may very well affect your grade.
You will find the AI questionnaire in [Moodle](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/mod/feedback/view.php?id=3339366) and the feedback form in [Norppa](https://norppa.helsinki.fi/targets/72439033/feedback).
Copy the code that's visible in the feedback form and submit it to Moodle to get your extra point.

### Grading
Final grades will be released in January in [Moodle](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=61184).
