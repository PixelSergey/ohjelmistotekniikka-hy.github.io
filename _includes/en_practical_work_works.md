## Making sure the project works as intended

- You must use Python version >= 3.8
- There are differences in how different computers work, and it is not enough that your code works on your machine.
- Your practical work must work, run, and be testable on the university's Cubbli Linux (fresher's laptop) machines. Otherwise, you will not get the points from the practical work.
- If you do not have a fresher's laptop, you can also use a [remote desktop connection](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/instructions/computer-and-printing/workstation-service/virtual-desktops-vdi). In this case, choose Cubbli Linux.
