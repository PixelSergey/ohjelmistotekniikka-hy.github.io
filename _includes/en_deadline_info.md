**⚠️ The deadline for this week's submissions is {{include.deadline}}.** You can do the tasks either by yourself or in the exercise sessions.

Return your work by pushing to the GitHub repository which you registered into [Labtooliin]({{site.labtool_link}}). **Remember to push your work before the deadline!** Any work pushed after midnight will not be taken into account (or will bring 0 points).

The points and feedback will be available before next week's deadline. **Please check your points and feedback.** If you get any questions or concerns about the grading, send a message through LabTool.
