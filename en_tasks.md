title: Tasks and practical work
---

The main bulk of the course is the practical work, which you will start working on during the 2nd week.
In the practical work, you will independently implement a software project based on a topic of your choosing.
The goal of the project is to apply and practice the skills studied during the prerequisite courses and practice finding information on your own.
You can find the instructions for the practical work in [the week 2 material](/en/tasks/week2#practical-work)

## Schedule

The first three weeks contain tasks/exercises that you can do either alone or in the exercise sessions.
For 6 weeks, starting on week 2, you will return incrementally growing versions of your practical work.
Points from both of these will be considered in your final grade.
